## Getting Started

The goal of this game is to bring your opponent's Life down to 0. To do so, you will need to out strategize your opponent with your randomized card set and win in a battle of wits. 

Player 1 is always first to start. Luckily for player 2, they won't be able to attack on turn 1. You begin the game by dragging your cards to the monster zone. Be careful however, because you have a limited resources called star power. If you don't have enough, you won't be able to cast your celebrities. You can see the star power cost for each card in the top right. Don't worry if you run out, you will passiveely generate 20 per turn.

You can choose to either attack your opponent's cards, or attack their life directly at any point. To do so, you can either drag your card to their card to initiate battle. Or you can drag your card straight to their life at the top of the screen to attack them! All cards have an attack stat, which is indicated in red at the bottom of the screen; as well as a defense stat indicated in blue. When you battle, the card's atack stat will be subtracted from eachothers defense stats.When a celebrity's defense stat drops down to 0, that card will be removed from the field never to return. Cards can only declare atacks once per turn.

Some cards have special abilties, you can tell what they do by their descriptions in the middle of the card under their portrait. Abilities add an exra layer of unpredicability and strategy to further add to the excitement.
